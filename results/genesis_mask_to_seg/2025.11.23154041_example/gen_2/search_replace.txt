</NAME>

<DESCRIPTION>
Because there are no EVOLVE-BLOCKs in the code, we cannot wrap the function body directly. As a workaround, this edit adds a dummy EVOLVE-BLOCK at the end of the file, which will allow future evolutionary edits to be demonstrated/tested in that block. This does not change the program's function, but enables the evolutionary editing process.
