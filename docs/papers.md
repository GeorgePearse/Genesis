## Overview

The intersection of Large Language Models (LLMs) and evolutionary computation has emerged as one of the most active research areas in AI. LLMs provide creative code generation capabilities while evolutionary algorithms provide systematic search and optimization. Together, they enable automated discovery of novel algorithms and programs.

Key themes in this research include:

- **Sample Efficiency**: Reducing the number of LLM calls needed to find good solutions
- **Open-Ended Evolution**: Continuous improvement without predefined stopping criteria
- **Verifiable Discovery**: Ensuring evolved solutions are correct and novel
- **Multi-Language Support**: Evolving code beyond just Python

## Foundational Systems

### FunSearch (DeepMind, 2024)

**Paper**: [Mathematical discoveries from program search with large language models](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06924-6) (Nature, 2024)

**GitHub**: [google-deepmind/funsearch](https://github.com/google-deepmind/funsearch)

FunSearch (Function Search) pairs a pretrained LLM with an automated evaluator in an evolutionary loop. Key innovations:

- **Island-Based Evolution**: Maintains diverse populations across islands to prevent premature convergence
- **No Fine-Tuning Required**: Works with API access to models like Codey or StarCoder

**Key Results**:

- First scientific discovery using an LLM: new solutions to the cap set problem (largest improvement in 20 years)
- Discovered more effective bin-packing algorithms with real-world applications
- Solutions are interpretable programs, not opaque neural outputs
