optimize_circle_placement
</NAME>

<DESCRIPTION>
To improve the arrangement of circles, I propose a modification that adjusts the placement of the outer circles to more effectively utilize the available space. Instead of placing the outer circles uniformly around the center, we will stagger their positions based on a calculated angle that takes into account the radii of the circles. This will help reduce overlaps and allow for larger radii for the outer circles. Additionally, we will introduce a mechanism to dynamically adjust the radii of the circles based on their distance from the center to maximize the overall sum of radii.

dynamic_radius_adjustment
</NAME>

<DESCRIPTION>
Introduce a dynamic adjustment for the radii of the circles based on their distance from the center. The outer circles should have larger radii compared to the initial uniform radius. This adjustment will allow for better packing and a higher combined score. We will modify the `compute_max_radii` function to account for a scaling factor that increases the radius of outer circles based on their distance from the center.
