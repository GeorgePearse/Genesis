optimize_circle_placement
</NAME>

<DESCRIPTION>
This modification enhances the circle placement strategy by adjusting the angles and radii used for positioning the circles, allowing for a more flexible arrangement. In particular, it introduces variable-sized radii and strategically places larger circles in clusters towards the center, while pushing smaller circles towards the corners. This helps to maximize the coverage and minimize overlaps.

Additionally, a revised approach with a basic optimization step is included to fine-tune the circle positions based on their initial arrangement. This creates a more efficient use of space in the unit square.
