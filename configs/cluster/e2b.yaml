# E2B Cloud Sandbox Configuration
# 
# This configuration enables running Genesis evaluations in E2B cloud sandboxes.
# E2B provides isolated, ephemeral environments for code execution.
#
# Prerequisites:
# 1. Set E2B_API_KEY in your .env file
# 2. Install e2b package: pip install e2b
#
# Benefits:
# - Highly parallel execution (each job runs in its own sandbox)
# - Isolated environments prevent interference between jobs
# - No local resource constraints
# - Automatic cleanup of sandbox environments

job_config:
  _target_: genesis.launch.E2BJobConfig
  eval_program_path: ${distributed_job_config.eval_program_path}
  
  # E2B sandbox template to use
  # Options: "base" (Python), or custom templates you've created
  template: "base"
  
  # Sandbox timeout in seconds (max time for each evaluation)
  timeout: 300
  
  # Python dependencies to install in each sandbox
  # These are installed via pip before running the evaluation
  dependencies:
    - numpy
    - scipy
  
  # Additional files to upload to the sandbox
  # Map of sandbox_path -> local_path
  # additional_files:
  #   "/home/user/data.json": "data/input.json"
  
  # Environment variables to set in the sandbox
  # env_vars:
  #   MY_VAR: "my_value"
  
evo_config:
  job_type: "e2b"
  # E2B supports high parallelism - adjust based on your E2B plan limits
  max_parallel_jobs: 10
