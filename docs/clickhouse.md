# ClickHouse Integration

Genesis includes comprehensive ClickHouse integration for tracking evolution runs, LLM interactions, and system events in real-time. All data is automatically logged to ClickHouse for analysis, visualization, and debugging.

## Quick Overview

**7 Tables** tracking different aspects of evolution:

| Table | Purpose | Row Count (typical) |
|-------|---------|---------------------|
| `evolution_runs` | Each experiment run | 1 per run |
| `generations` | Per-generation stats | 10-100 per run |
| `individuals` | Every code variant | 100-1000s per run |
| `pareto_fronts` | Pareto frontier snapshots | 3-20 per generation |
| `code_lineages` | Parent-child relationships | Same as individuals |
| `llm_logs` | Every LLM API call | 1000s per run |
| `agent_actions` | System events | 100s per run |

## Setup

1. **Set Environment Variable:**
   ```bash
   export CLICKHOUSE_URL="https://user:password@host:port/database"
   ```
   Or add to your `.env` file.

2. **Install Client:**

## Schema Design Decisions

### Why ClickHouse?

1. **High Write Throughput** - Handle 1000s of individual evaluations per minute
2. **Fast Analytics** - Aggregate across millions of rows in milliseconds
3. **Time-Series Optimized** - Sorted by timestamp for efficient range queries
4. **Columnar Storage** - Only read columns you need (efficient for wide tables)
5. **JSON Support** - Flexible `metrics` and `config` fields without schema migrations

### MergeTree Engine

All tables use `ENGINE = MergeTree()` which:
- Sorts data by `ORDER BY` key for fast queries
- Compresses data efficiently (10x+ compression typical)
- Supports fast upserts and deletes (via mutations)
- Handles high insert rates without blocking reads

### Data Volume Estimates

For a typical run with **20 individuals × 10 generations**:

| Table | Rows | Storage (uncompressed) | Storage (compressed) |
|-------|------|------------------------|----------------------|
| `evolution_runs` | 1 | ~2 KB | ~500 bytes |
| `generations` | 10 | ~2 KB | ~500 bytes |
| `individuals` | 200 | ~100 KB | ~10 KB |
| `pareto_fronts` | ~50 | ~10 KB | ~2 KB |
| `code_lineages` | 200 | ~50 KB | ~5 KB |
| `llm_logs` | ~400 | ~2 MB | ~200 KB |
| `agent_actions` | ~500 | ~200 KB | ~20 KB |
| **Total** | **~1361** | **~2.4 MB** | **~240 KB** |

**Scaling:**
- 1000 runs → ~240 MB (compressed)
- 10,000 runs → ~2.4 GB (compressed)

ClickHouse handles this easily. Even with millions of individuals, queries remain fast.

## Data Retention

ClickHouse is designed for high-volume data. Consider setting TTL policies for log tables:

```sql
-- Keep LLM logs for 30 days (if you want to save space)
ALTER TABLE llm_logs 
MODIFY TTL timestamp + INTERVAL 30 DAY;

-- Keep agent actions for 90 days
ALTER TABLE agent_actions
MODIFY TTL timestamp + INTERVAL 90 DAY;

-- Keep evolution data forever
-- No TTL on: evolution_runs, generations, individuals, pareto_fronts, code_lineages
```

**Recommended:** Keep evolution tables (`individuals`, `pareto_fronts`, `code_lineages`) forever for reproducibility. They compress well and are essential for analyzing evolutionary dynamics.

## Visualization

You can connect ClickHouse to visualization tools:
- **Grafana** - Real-time dashboards
- **Metabase** - SQL-based exploration
- **Jupyter** - Python analysis with `clickhouse-connect`

Example Jupyter notebook:

```python
from clickhouse_connect import get_client
import pandas as pd

client = get_client(
    host='your-host',
    port=8443,
    username='default',
    password='your-password',
    secure=True
)

# Query as DataFrame
df = client.query_df("""
    SELECT generation, best_score, avg_score
    FROM generations
    WHERE run_id = 'run_12345'
    ORDER BY generation
""")

df.plot(x='generation', y=['best_score', 'avg_score'])
```

## Common Queries Cheatsheet

```sql
-- Find best individual across all runs for a task
SELECT i.run_id, i.individual_id, i.generation, i.fitness_score, i.metrics
FROM individuals i
JOIN evolution_runs r ON i.run_id = r.run_id
WHERE r.task_name = 'circle_packing'
ORDER BY i.fitness_score DESC
LIMIT 1;

-- Evolution progress dashboard
SELECT 
    g.generation,
    g.best_score,
    g.avg_score,
    g.pareto_size,
    g.total_cost,
    countIf(i.is_pareto) as pareto_actual
FROM generations g
LEFT JOIN individuals i ON g.run_id = i.run_id AND g.generation = i.generation
WHERE g.run_id = 'YOUR_RUN_ID'
GROUP BY g.generation, g.best_score, g.avg_score, g.pareto_size, g.total_cost
ORDER BY g.generation;

-- Cost breakdown by component
SELECT 
    sum(api_cost) as total_mutation_cost,
    sum(embed_cost) as total_embedding_cost,
    sum(novelty_cost) as total_novelty_cost,
    sum(api_cost + embed_cost + novelty_cost) as total_cost
FROM individuals
WHERE run_id = 'YOUR_RUN_ID';

-- Mutation type effectiveness
SELECT 
    mutation_type,
    count() as count,
    avg(fitness_score) as avg_fitness,
    quantile(0.5)(fitness_score) as median_fitness,
    quantile(0.9)(fitness_score) as p90_fitness
FROM individuals
WHERE run_id = 'YOUR_RUN_ID' AND generation > 0
GROUP BY mutation_type;

-- Find generations with breakthroughs (>10% improvement)
SELECT 
    generation,
    best_score,
    best_score - lagInFrame(best_score) OVER (ORDER BY generation) as improvement,
    improvement / lagInFrame(best_score) OVER (ORDER BY generation) as improvement_pct
FROM generations
WHERE run_id = 'YOUR_RUN_ID'
HAVING improvement_pct > 0.1
ORDER BY improvement_pct DESC;

-- LLM cost by model
SELECT 
    model,
    count() as calls,
    sum(cost) as total_cost,
    avg(cost) as avg_cost_per_call,
    sum(execution_time) as total_time_seconds
FROM llm_logs
GROUP BY model
ORDER BY total_cost DESC;
```

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues

**"ClickHouse logging disabled"**
- Check `CLICKHOUSE_URL` is set: `echo $CLICKHOUSE_URL`
- Verify format: `https://user:password@host:port/database`
- Test connection: `python scripts/test_clickhouse.py`

**"clickhouse-connect not installed"**
```bash
uv pip install clickhouse-connect
```

**"Connection refused"**
- Check host/port are correct
- Verify firewall allows outbound connections to ClickHouse port
- For ClickHouse Cloud, ensure you're using HTTPS (port 8443) not HTTP (port 8123)

### Data Issues

**"No data in tables"**
- Tables are created automatically but only populated when you integrate logging calls
- Check `llm_logs` and `agent_actions` - these are auto-populated by existing code
- Evolution tables (`evolution_runs`, `individuals`, etc.) require integration in `runner.py`

**"Duplicate data"**
- ClickHouse MergeTree allows duplicates by default
- Use `code_hash` to deduplicate individuals
- Set up a `ReplacingMergeTree` if you need automatic deduplication

**"Queries are slow"**
- Always filter by `run_id` when possible (it's in the ORDER BY key)
- Use `timestamp` ranges for time-based queries
- Avoid `SELECT *` - specify only needed columns

## Next Steps

To integrate ClickHouse logging into your evolution runs:

1. **Update `runner.py`** - Add calls to `log_evolution_run`, `log_generation`, `log_individual`
2. **Update evaluation** - Log individual metrics after each evaluation
3. **Track Pareto** - Call `log_pareto_front` after each generation
4. **Set up dashboards** - Create Grafana dashboards for real-time monitoring

See `genesis/utils/clickhouse_logger.py` for the full API.
