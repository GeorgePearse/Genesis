adaptive_circle_packing_with_center_focus
</NAME>

<DESCRIPTION>
To improve the performance of the circle packing algorithm, I propose a modification to the initial placement of circles. Instead of random placements, we will strategically place larger circles closer to the center of the unit square and smaller circles towards the edges. This approach leverages the fact that larger circles can occupy central positions without overlapping, while smaller circles can fill the outer regions. This should enhance the overall packing efficiency and maximize the sum of the radii.

<DESCRIPTION>
To further enhance the packing efficiency, I suggest modifying the overlap prevention mechanism. Instead of simply scaling the radii when overlaps are detected, we will introduce a buffer zone that allows for smoother adjustments. This will help maintain the integrity of the circle sizes while preventing overlaps more effectively. The buffer will be a small constant added to the sum of the radii during the overlap check.
