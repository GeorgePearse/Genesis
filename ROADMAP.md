# Genesis Roadmap

## Vision

Genesis aims to be the universal framework for LLM-driven code evolution across any programming language, execution environment, and optimization objective.

## Current Language Support

| Language | Local | Slurm | E2B (base) | E2B (custom) | Notes |
|----------|:-----:|:-----:|:----------:|:------------:|-------|
| **Python** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | First-class support, all features |
| **Rust** | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | Needs `rustc` in environment |
| **C++** | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | Needs `g++` or `clang++` |
| **CUDA** | ⚠️ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | Requires GPU + `nvcc` |
| **JavaScript/TypeScript** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Node.js available in E2B base |

### Adding New Language Support

To evolve code in any language, you need:

1. **Compiler/Interpreter** in the execution environment
2. **Python evaluation wrapper** that:
   - Compiles the evolved code (if needed)
   - Runs it against test cases
   - Returns a numeric fitness score

See `examples/mask_to_seg_rust/` for a complete Rust example.

## Planned Improvements

### High Priority

#### E2B Templates for Compiled Languages
- [ ] Pre-built E2B templates with common toolchains:
  - `genesis-rust` - Rust toolchain (rustc, cargo)
  - `genesis-cpp` - C++ toolchain (g++, clang++, cmake)
  - `genesis-go` - Go toolchain
  - `genesis-full` - All languages combined
- [ ] One-command template deployment
- [ ] Documentation for custom template creation

#### Modal Integration for GPU Code
- [ ] CUDA kernel evolution with GPU execution
- [ ] PyTorch/JAX model optimization
- [ ] Serverless GPU with automatic scaling
- [ ] Cost tracking and budget limits

#### Improved Rust Support
- [ ] Cargo project support (not just single-file rustc)
- [ ] Crate dependency management
- [ ] SIMD-aware optimization prompts
- [ ] Benchmark-driven fitness (criterion.rs integration)

### Medium Priority

#### Language-Specific LLM Optimization Hints
- [ ] **Rust**: Ownership/borrowing patterns, SIMD intrinsics, zero-copy
- [ ] **C++**: Template metaprogramming, cache optimization, vectorization
- [ ] **CUDA**: Warp efficiency, shared memory, occupancy optimization
- [ ] **Python**: NumPy vectorization, Cython hints, memory views

#### Multi-Language Project Evolution
- [ ] Python + Rust (PyO3 bindings)
- [ ] Python + C++ (pybind11)
- [ ] Evolve both sides of FFI boundaries
- [ ] Cross-language fitness evaluation

#### Database Modernization (ClickHouse Backend)
- [ ] **Full ClickHouse Migration**: Move the operational backend (program storage, metadata) entirely to ClickHouse.
  - Replace SQLite `programs` table with ClickHouse `MergeTree` engines.
  - Implement real-time inserts/updates using ClickHouse best practices (ReplacingMergeTree or CollapsingMergeTree).
  - Eliminate the need for local SQLite files, enabling stateless execution nodes.
- [ ] **Data Normalization**: Design a normalized ClickHouse schema to replace the current JSON-heavy structure.
  - Extract metrics into dedicated columns/tables for fast analytical queries.
  - Store lineage and relationships efficiently.
- [ ] **Distributed Storage**: Leverage ClickHouse's distributed tables for multi-node scaling.

#### Enhanced Parallelism
- [ ] Adaptive `max_parallel_jobs` based on backend capacity
- [ ] Job priority queuing
- [ ] Preemption for higher-fitness candidates
- [ ] Distributed island model across backends

#### Reasoning & Verification (Inspired by OpenR)
- [ ] **Process Reward Models for Code**
  - Train PRMs to evaluate intermediate code states (not just final fitness)
  - Discriminative models: Score quality of each code modification step
  - Generative models: Predict likelihood of successful evolution path
  - Dataset: Collect step-by-step evolution traces with fitness improvements

- [ ] **Self-Improving Task Prompts (DSPy Integration)**
  - **MIPRO-style Instruction Optimization**: Implement an "outer loop" that treats the `task_sys_msg` as a variable.
    - Run short evolution "micro-sprints" (e.g., 5 generations).
    - Use a meta-LLM to propose variations of the task prompt.
    - Select the prompt phrasing that yields the highest average population fitness.
  - **Bootstrap Few-Shot Selection**: Instead of just random "Top-K" inspirations, use an optimizer to select the *most effective* historical mutations to show as few-shot examples.
    - Learn which types of examples (e.g., "small refactor" vs "algorithm swap") lead to better LLM outputs for the specific task.
  - **Signature-based Prompts**: Abstract prompts into Input/Output signatures (e.g., `Code -> ImprovedCode`), allowing the system to automatically format and structure the prompt implementation.

#### SAGA Framework Integration

Integrate concepts from [SAGA (Self-Adapting Goal-Evolving Agents)](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.21782v1) to enable bi-level optimization: evolving both solutions (current) and objectives (new). See [`docs/saga_integration.md`](docs/saga_integration.md) for detailed design.

**Objective Evolution** (High Priority)
- [ ] Implement dynamic fitness function evolution
  - Create `genesis/core/objective_evolution.py` module

  - Add prompts for LLM-driven objective analysis
- [ ] Detect reward hacking via population analysis
  - LLM analyzes top programs for suspicious metric patterns
  - Identifies exploitation vs genuine optimization
  - Proposes objective reweighting to address issues
- [ ] LLM-driven metric reweighting
  - Dynamic computation of `combined_score` from raw metrics
  - Objective weights evolve based on reward hacking detection
  - Track objective version history in database
- [ ] Multi-objective Pareto frontier tracking

  - Show objective evolution preventing reward hacking

**Modular Architecture** (Medium Priority)

Extract clean four-module design (Planner, Implementer, Optimizer, Analyzer) from current monolithic `EvolutionRunner`. See [`docs/modular_architecture.md`](docs/modular_architecture.md) for refactoring plan.

- [ ] Extract clean interfaces for four SAGA modules
  - Define `PlannerInterface`, `ImplementerInterface`, `OptimizerInterface`, `AnalyzerInterface`
  - Create `genesis/core/interfaces.py` with abstract base classes
  - Document interface contracts and expected behaviors
- [ ] Refactor EvolutionRunner into slim orchestrator
  - Reduce from 1756 lines to ~200 lines
  - Delegate to module interfaces instead of inline logic
  - Maintain backward compatibility via factory functions
- [ ] Plugin architecture for custom module implementations
  - Hydra config groups for each module type
  - Enable swapping modules via configuration
  - Example: `optimizer: bayesian` vs `optimizer: island_evolution`
- [ ] Dependency injection for extensibility
  - Module instances passed to EvolutionRunner constructor
  - Support alternative implementations (Bayesian, MCTS, etc.)
  - Test module isolation and composition

**Human-in-the-Loop** (Medium Priority)
- [ ] Three-tier autonomy system (co-pilot/semi-pilot/autopilot)
  - **Co-pilot**: Human reviews and approves each objective change
  - **Semi-pilot**: Human reviews analyzer insights before auto-evolution
  - **Autopilot**: Fully autonomous (current behavior, default)
- [ ] Interactive approval gates at meta_rec_interval
  - Pause evolution when objective changes proposed

    - Each node is a code variant
    - Use PRM to guide expansion (UCB-like selection)
    - Rollouts via LLM-predicted fitness estimates
  - [ ] Beam Search Evolution: Keep top-k candidates per generation
  - [ ] Best-of-N with Learned Verifiers: Generate N mutations, select via PRM
  - [ ] rStar-style Mutual Reasoning: Cross-verify mutations via multiple LLMs
  
- [ ] **Pre-Execution Code Verification**
  - [ ] Static analysis-based fitness prediction (before running code)
  - [ ] Syntax/type correctness filters to avoid wasted evaluations
